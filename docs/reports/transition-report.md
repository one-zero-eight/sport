# Usefulness and Transition report

> **Question:** Is the product complete? Which parts are done and which aren’t done?  
> **Answer:** The backend is nearly complete, requiring only optimization and cleanup; the frontend is about one‑half done (student interface implemented) with coach interface still pending.

> **Question:** Is the customer using the product? How often? In what way? If not, why not?  
> **Answer:** First two courses continue using the old sport website daily, but new website still not adopted because it isn’t yet production‑ready.

> **Question:** Has the customer deployed the product on their side?  
> **Answer:** No. Deployment is planned once the remaining work is finished. However, they expect to complete deploying in a single evening following the provided guidelines.

> **Question:** What measures need to be taken to fully transition the product?  
> **Answer:** Finish and polish the frontend, optimize backend routes, define and instrument key engagement metrics, conduct thorough code validation and security testing, and prepare deployment parameters per the customer’s specs.

> **Question:** What are the customer’s plans for the product after its delivery? Are they going to continue working on it? Would they like to continue collaborating with the team and on what conditions?  
> **Answer:** After delivery they will test and lock in the new frontend, replacing the old one. They are open to ongoing collaboration (including on future projects) under informal, goodwill‑based terms (no direct payment, only occasional “innopoints” or merch).

> **Question:** How to increase the chance that it’ll be useful after the final delivery?  
> **Answer:** Maintain a clean, well‑supported codebase, continue active support, and involve new developers to drive improvements and catch regressions.

> **Customer feedback on your README**  
> **Question:** Is everything clear? What can be improved?  
> **Answer:** The instructions are clear and logically ordered; they suggest shortening the README, removing in‑depth documentation, and migrating long docs to separate MD files.
> **Question:** Are they able to launch/deploy using your instructions?  
> **Answer:** Yes; they confirmed that by following the top‑to‑bottom instructions they can run and deploy both backend and frontend in one evening.
> **Question:** What two other sections would the customer like to see included in the README?  
> **Answer:** They prefer not to add any additional sections; if deeper documentation is needed, it should live in a separate Docs‑MD repository.
